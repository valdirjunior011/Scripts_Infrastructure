== Installation and How Use ==
==========================

First, Copy this script to your XenServer (or XenServer poll), AND turn it into an executable.
A default for storing this file is:

/usr/local/bin/snapback.sh.

Next, create a cron task so that the script can be run daily after 1AM.
The file to create is /etc/cron.d/backup with the following line:

2 1 \* \* \* root /usr/local/bin/snapback.sh > /var/log/snapback.log 2>&1

This line will also add the logging actions to the file /var/log/snapback.log
You now need to edit the script and change the variable DEST_SR to the UUID of your storage where you intend to store your backups.

\*To find this UUID just click on your SR in Xencenter, the UUID value will be shown similar to this example "2c01dc26-f525-70d6-dedf-00baaec76645".

Finally you need to configure your VM backup and retention policy.
In Xencenter left click on your VM and select "Properties",
Click "Custom Fields" and then "Edit Custom Fields". You must add two texts to the fields:

backup: this can be "daily", "weekly" or "monthly". If it is set to
weekly by default it will run on a Sunday, and if set to monthly
it will run on the first Sunday of the month. This day can be changed in the
top of the script - see the WEEKLY_ON and MONTHLY_ON variables.

retain: how many previous backups (in addition to the currently running files)
backup) to keep. So setting it to a value of "2" would mean that after
one backup is run, you will have three backups in total.

The script will look for these fields when it runs and ignore any VM
that does not have them set. You can also see them in the Xencenter summary
summary and properties for the VM.

Now you can run the script manually or wait until the cron job
job starts. It will produce a detailed log in the console (or log file if
run cron) and when finished you will see the backup of your
VMs listed in Xencenter.

If you find that this clutters up Xencenter's display a bit, you can always
hide them (View->Server View->Custom Templates).

To restore a VM from a backup, right click and choose "New Backup Template".

That's all
